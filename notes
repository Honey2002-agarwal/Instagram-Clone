// CDN stands for Content Delivery Network. It is a system of servers distributed geographically around the world, designed to improve the performance, speed, and reliability of delivering website content such as images, videos, scripts, and other static assets to end-users.
// If you were to create an Instagram clone using HTML and CSS, you would need to deliver a lot of images to the user. These images would include user profile pictures, uploaded images, and images in the Instagram feed. These images can take a long time to load, especially if the user is located far away from the server where the images are hosted.

// Using a CDN in this scenario can help improve the performance of your website by caching the images on servers located around the world. When a user accesses your Instagram clone, the CDN will automatically deliver the images from the server closest to the user, reducing the time it takes to load the images.

// Furthermore, a CDN can also help to reduce the load on your server by serving static assets such as images, CSS files, and JavaScript files. This can help improve the scalability and availability of your website, as well as reduce the bandwidth and hosting costs.

// Overall, using a CDN can improve the user experience of your Instagram clone by reducing the loading time of images, improving website performance, and increasing website availability.

// Explain margin and padding in css with a real life example 

// In CSS, margin and padding are two CSS properties used to create space around an HTML element. While they are similar in functionality, they are used for different purposes.

// Padding is the space inside an element between the element’s content and its border. It is used to create space between the content and the border. Padding can be applied to all four sides of an element, or to specific sides using the shorthand notation.

// For example, consider a button on a webpage. To make the text inside the button not touch the edges of the button, you can use the following CSS code:

// css
// Copy code
// button {
//   padding: 10px 20px;
// }
// This will create 10 pixels of space on the top and bottom of the button content, and 20 pixels of space on the left and right of the button content.

// Margin, on the other hand, is the space outside an element, between the element’s border and the next element. It is used to create space between adjacent elements. Margin can be applied to all four sides of an element, or to specific sides using the shorthand notation.

// For example, consider two paragraphs on a webpage. To create some space between the two paragraphs, you can use the following CSS code:

// css
// Copy code
// p {
//   margin-bottom: 20px;
// }
// This will create 20 pixels of space between the bottom of one paragraph and the top of the next paragraph.

// In summary, padding is used to create space inside an element, while margin is used to create space outside an element. Both properties can be used to adjust the spacing between elements on a webpage and create a more visually appealing design.

// :root{
//     --gradient:linear-gradient(to right,#e2336b,#fcac46)
// }
// Explain this

// This is a CSS custom property defined at the root level of the document. It sets the value of a variable named "--gradient" to a linear gradient that goes from the color #e2336b to #fcac46, from left to right direction.

// This variable can then be used throughout the document wherever it is needed by referencing its name as "var(--gradient)".

// Using CSS custom properties like this can make it easier to maintain consistency across a website or application, and allows for easy modification of colors, fonts, and other styling elements.

// Is this deprecated?
// No, this is not deprecated. The use of CSS custom properties (also known as CSS variables) like this is a current and widely supported practice in modern web development. Custom properties are now part of the CSS specification, and are supported by all modern web browsers, including Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and Edge.

// In fact, the use of custom properties is becoming increasingly popular in modern web development as they allow for more efficient and flexible CSS styling. By defining variables at the root level of a document, developers can easily update and modify multiple styling elements across the document by simply updating the value of the variable, rather than needing to manually update each individual instance of a particular color or style.

// Okay so explain each and every line of the code in details
// Sure! Here's a detailed explanation of each line of the code:

// css
// Copy code
// :root{
//     --gradient:linear-gradient(to right,#e2336b,#fcac46)
// }
// :root: This selector targets the root element of the document, which in the case of an HTML document is the html element. Using :root ensures that the defined custom property will be available globally throughout the document.

// --gradient: This is the name of the custom property being defined. Custom properties are always prefixed with two dashes (--) to differentiate them from regular CSS properties.

// linear-gradient(to right,#e2336b,#fcac46): This is the value of the --gradient custom property. It defines a linear gradient that goes from left to right, with the starting color #e2336b and the ending color #fcac46.

// Overall, this code defines a custom property named --gradient that contains a linear gradient that can be used anywhere in the document by referencing it as var(--gradient). For example, the gradient could be applied to a background color or a border using the following CSS:

// css
// Copy code
// .element {
//   background: var(--gradient);
// }
// This would apply the linear gradient defined in --gradient as the background color of the .element class.




// dashimanish31@gmail.com
// What is this gradient
// The linear-gradient is a CSS function that creates a linear gradient that transitions between two or more colors. In this particular case, the gradient transitions from the color #e2336b to #fcac46 in a left-to-right direction.

// The syntax of the linear-gradient function is as follows:

// css
// Copy code
// linear-gradient([direction], [color-stop1], [color-stop2], [...]);
// direction: This specifies the direction of the gradient. It can be one of to top, to right, to bottom, to left, to top left, to top right, to bottom left, to bottom right, or an angle in degrees (e.g., 45deg).
// color-stop: This specifies the color at a particular point along the gradient line. It can be expressed in various formats, such as hex codes, RGB, HSL, or named colors. Multiple color stops can be specified to create more complex gradients.
// In the code you provided, the linear-gradient function is used with the direction to right, which means the gradient will transition from left to right. The first color stop is #e2336b, which is the starting color of the gradient, and the second color stop is #fcac46, which is the ending color of the gradient. These two colors will smoothly transition into each other across the gradient line.

// What is z-index?
// z-index is a CSS property that controls the vertical stacking order of positioned elements that overlap in a web page. It specifies the position of an element along the z-axis, which is the axis perpendicular to the screen or viewport. Elements with a higher z-index value will appear on top of elements with a lower z-index value.

// The z-index property only affects positioned elements, which are elements with a position value of relative, absolute, or fixed. By default, all positioned elements have a z-index value of auto, which means they will be stacked in the order they appear in the HTML document.

// Here is an example of how to use z-index:

// css
// Copy code
// .box1 {
//   position: relative;
//   z-index: 2;
// }

// .box2 {
//   position: relative;
//   z-index: 1;
// }
// In this example, the .box1 element has a higher z-index value than the .box2 element, so it will appear on top of .box2. If both elements had the same z-index value, the stacking order would be determined by their order in the HTML document.

// It's important to note that the z-index property only affects the stacking order of elements that overlap in the same stacking context. If an element is in a different stacking context, its z-index value will not affect the stacking order of elements in the original stacking context. To create a new stacking context, an element can be given a position value of relative, absolute, or fixed, and a z-index value other than auto.

// .main-home {
//     position: absolute;
//     width: calc(1001%-300px);
//     top: 0;
//     left: 300px;
//     background: #fff;
//     border-radius: 1rem 0 0 1rem;
//     z-index: 1000;
//   }
//   Explain me the full code in details
//   Sure! Here's a detailed explanation of each line of the code you provided:
  
//   css
//   Copy code
//   .main-home {
//     position: absolute;
//     width: calc(1001% - 300px);
//     top: 0;
//     left: 300px;
//     background: #fff;
//     border-radius: 1rem 0 0 1rem;
//     z-index: 1000;
//   }
//   .main-home: This is a CSS class selector that targets elements with the class main-home.
  
//   position: absolute;: This sets the position property of the .main-home element to absolute. This means the element will be positioned relative to its nearest positioned ancestor (or the document body if there are no positioned ancestors), and its position will be determined by its top, bottom, left, and right properties.
  
//   width: calc(1001% - 300px);: This sets the width property of the .main-home element to the result of the calc function, which calculates the width of the element based on a formula. In this case, the formula subtracts 300 pixels from 1001% of the width of the containing block. This means the element will take up 1001% of the width of its containing block minus 300 pixels.
  
//   top: 0;: This sets the top property of the .main-home element to 0, which means the top edge of the element will be aligned with the top edge of its nearest positioned ancestor.
  
//   left: 300px;: This sets the left property of the .main-home element to 300px, which means the left edge of the element will be positioned 300 pixels from the left edge of its nearest positioned ancestor.
  
//   background: #fff;: This sets the background property of the .main-home element to #fff, which means the background color of the element will be white.
  
//   border-radius: 1rem 0 0 1rem;: This sets the border-radius property of the .main-home element to 1rem 0 0 1rem, which means the top-left and bottom-left corners of the element will be rounded with a radius of 1rem, while the other two corners will be square.
  
//   z-index: 1000;: This sets the z-index property of the .main-home element to 1000, which means the element will appear on top of elements with lower z-index values.
  
//   In summary, this code sets the style of an element with the class main-home to be positioned absolutely, take up 1001% of the width of its containing block minus 300 pixels, have a white background color, and rounded corners on the top-left and bottom-left. It will be positioned at the top-left of its nearest positioned ancestor, which is 300 pixels from the left edge. Finally, it will be placed on top of other elements with a z-index value of less than 1000.

// .profile{
//     display: flex;
//     flex-direction: column;
//     align-items: center;
//     justify-content: center;
//     margin-top: 1.4rem;
//   }
//   .profile: This is a CSS class selector that targets elements with the class profile.
  
//   display: flex;: This sets the display property of the .profile-img element to flex, which turns the element into a flex container.
  
//   flex-direction: column;: This sets the flex-direction property of the .profile-img element to column, which means the child elements of the container will be stacked vertically.
  
//   align-items: center;: This sets the align-items property of the .profile-img element to center, which means the child elements of the container will be horizontally centered within the container.
  
//   justify-content: center;: This sets the justify-content property of the .profile-img element to center, which means the child elements of the container will be vertically centered within the container.
  
//   margin-top: 1.4rem;: This sets the margin-top property of the .profile-img element to 1.4rem, which adds a margin of 1.4rem to the top of the element.
  
//   In summary, this code sets the style of an element with the class profile-img to be a flex container with a vertical stacking direction (flex-direction: column), with its child elements horizontally and vertically centered within the container (align-items: center and justify-content: center). It also adds a margin-top of 1.4rem to the element.
  
// What is flex in css
// flex is a CSS layout property that is used to create flexible containers and flexible items within those containers.

// When a container is set to display: flex, its children become flexible items that can be arranged in a row or a column. The flex-direction property controls the direction of the items, and the justify-content and align-items properties control the alignment of the items within the container.

// Flexible items can also be individually controlled using the flex-grow, flex-shrink, and flex-basis properties. These properties determine how much a flexible item can grow or shrink relative to the other items in the container.

// Flex is a powerful and widely-used layout tool in CSS that allows for responsive and dynamic page layouts. It can be used to create complex designs that adapt to different screen sizes and device orientations.
